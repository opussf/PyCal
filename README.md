# PyCal

This will be a rewrite of a very old project of mine.

The original created a 2-3 week calendar, using today as the first day to create a calendar of up coming events.
The idea came back recently when I was using a calendar display to organize my todo list.

Another idea of giving small tasks an amount of time, and then doing them when you have an amount of time available.
